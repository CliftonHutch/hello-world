My First Repository
Hello there,
I am currently in school for Software Development at CPCC in Charlotte, NC. I've only just begun 8-16. So far I've had intro to HTML / Database(Microsft Access) / and Intro to Java(Feeling lost:( ). I hope to further my understanding with code not only for the courses that I'm planning to take, but also learn some new funky Languages!!
